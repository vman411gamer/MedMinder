Glassware that reminds you to take your pills and much more.

Asks you what you would like to call your pill timer (ie Afternoon Pills or the actual name of the pill), it then asks you to input the time to remind you to take that pill. When it reminds you, you can either say you took the pill, (which is the same as the stop option in most glassware) or "remind me in..." Choosing this option will bring to you (basically) a timer. You will put in the time you wanted to be reminded in, and the live card will dissapear until that time has been reached. More features will be added in later versions.
